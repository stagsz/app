# REAL DOCUSIGN COMPLAINTS FROM USERS (2024-2025)

## OVERAGE FEES & BILLING SHOCK

### Quote 1: Texas Tax Business
> "I was told I would have 100 envelopes a month for a $65.00 monthly subscription. I have discovered that it's 100 envelopes per year and once I have gone over 100 envelopes it's $6.50 per envelope. I have spent 5 hours on phone calls trying to change my plan and am currently on hold for a supervisor."
- **Source**: BBB Complaint (2025)
- **Business Impact**: 5+ hours of support calls + confusion about basic plan details

### Quote 2: The $3000 Overage Shock
> "He explained to me that my only options at that point way to pay for the overages or to sign a contract that was $1500 to sign a contract for a year. He said to pay for my 30 overages it would be $3000...just complete shock."
- **Source**: 6 News Investigation (Tax firm with 1500-2000 customers/year)
- **Business Impact**: Was paying $300/year, suddenly faced $3000 bill for just 30 extra documents
- **Context**: DocuSign reps wouldn't provide itemized breakdown, insisted "it's a standard fee"

### Quote 3: Annual Plan Confusion
> "I am on a prepaid annual Realtors Plan with DocuSign, which costs $480 per year and includes unlimited envelopes. On January 11, 2025, DocuSign charged my card an additional $962.80 for overage usage without providing any prior notice, invoice, or authorization."
- **Source**: BBB Complaint (2025)
- **Business Impact**: Unexpected $962.80 charge despite supposedly "unlimited" plan
- **Issue**: Plan said "unlimited" but had hidden limits and arbitrary thresholds

### Quote 4: Multiple Seat Confusion
> "I purchased 1 seat and 100 envelopes on 8/23/24. I ran out of envelopes and on 1/15/25 I purchased additional 2 seats and 200 envelopes for $269.60. I thought I was giving myself 100 envelopes to the current seat and adding one other seat. Come in Aug for my renewal, they wanted to charge me $958.50 for 3 seats and 300 envelopes. I was not aware that I would have three seats now...My card was declined due to the high payment."
- **Source**: BBB Complaint (2025)
- **Business Impact**: Expected renewal of ~$300, charged $958.50
- **Context**: Sales rep never explained the seat structure properly

## CUSTOMER SERVICE NIGHTMARES

### Quote 5: Unreachable Support
> "I am signed up for an unlimited account. I pay hundreds each year for an unlimited account and my office manager is a user on my account. She has started getting emails from DocuSign notifying her that our account is susceptible to overage fees... Attempts to email support@docusign get an autoresponse 'This is an unmonitored mailbox. To contact DocuSign Support please visit support.docusign.com/contactSupport.' Support.docusign.com requires that I log in. Login attempts get the response 'Unable to log in.'"
- **Source**: DocuSign Community Forum (2024)
- **Business Impact**: Paying hundreds/year but can't access support when problem occurs
- **Context**: Sent to unmonitored mailbox, support site broken, phone support shutting down

### Quote 6: Phantom Calls
> "Poor customer service from the Philippines. When you try calling, the line would suddenly close (on a minimum of 12 calls on 15, when waiting for somebody to respond, the call would stop like someone hung up). When you finally reach somebody from their customer service in Philippines, they can't really help you, especially if this would affect their customer service stats."
- **Source**: GetApp Reviews
- **Business Impact**: Wasted hours on dropped calls, outsourced support can't solve problems
- **Issue**: Metrics-driven support reps don't actually help

### Quote 7: Arrogant Staff
> "DocuSign staff are often arrogant and do not read correspondence thoroughly; more to the point, they would prefer not to read it at all. In my view, it would be best to replace them with AI...Their operation is disjointed; management appears to lack care."
- **Source**: Trustpilot
- **Business Impact**: Frustrated customer with ongoing dispute since April
- **Context**: Multiple contacts within DocuSign, still unresolved

---

## CANCELLATION NIGHTMARES

### Quote 8: Impossible to Cancel
> "Terrible. DO NOT USE. Once you've signed up they make it impossible to cancel your plan - and even after cancelling it, then continued to charge you. Then, they make you pay MORE MONEY just to open your account."
- **Source**: Trustpilot
- **Business Impact**: Continued charges after cancellation
- **Context**: Multiple payment issues on top of cancellation problems

### Quote 9: 13-Year Customer Can't Change Plan
> "Client for over 13 years and so far after about 45 minutes it has been impossible to change my plan. I now want to cancel and keep getting a response they cannot process my request."
- **Source**: Trustpilot
- **Business Impact**: After 13 YEARS of loyalty, can't make changes
- **Context**: Company claims they "cannot process" the request

### Quote 10: Auto-Renewal Deception
> "Their website and customer support give conflicting information about refunds, and they automatically renewed my subscription without any prior notice or clear warning. When I tried to cancel, they refused to refund even though I reached out immediately."
- **Source**: Capterra (Oct 2025)
- **Business Impact**: Auto-renewed, can't get refund despite contacting immediately
- **Context**: Conflicting info on website vs support

## PRICING & TRANSPARENCY COMPLAINTS

### Quote 11: Complex Pricing Model
> "Overage fees are charged per additional envelope or API call beyond the plan's limit. The rates for these fees are not explicitly published, making cost predictability challenging."
- **Source**: Certinal Analysis (2025)
- **Business Impact**: Can't budget or predict costs
- **Context**: Hidden pricing is standard practice

### Quote 12: Enterprise Pricing Hidden
> "Docusign is more expensive than many competitors, and the envelope caps in paid plans feel restrictive if you send documents regularly. However, when it comes to pricing, I found that it is overpriced."
- **Source**: ThBusinessDive Review (2025)
- **Business Impact**: 5-15% annual price increases on renewal, even with low growth
- **Context**: Pricing structure designed to extract maximum value

### Quote 13: SMB Pricing Shock
> "A mid-tier team of 10 users could exceed $3,000 annually before add-ons, straining SMB budgets. Pricing is notably high compared to market averages."
- **Source**: eSignGlobal Analysis (2025)
- **Business Impact**: $3000+ for what should be a $200-300/month tool
- **Context**: Enterprise pricing structure on SMB product

## FEATURE & USABILITY COMPLAINTS

### Quote 14: Complex Setup
> "Advanced features can feel a bit complicated to set up, especially when creating templates or customizing workflows. I've noticed that the interface occasionally feels a little clunky when formatting fields."
- **Source**: G2 Review (2025)
- **Business Impact**: Steep learning curve for basic tasks
- **Context**: Should be simple but requires expertise

### Quote 15: Missing Basic Features
> "You cannot create documents in DocuSign. You can only upload existing documents and add e-signature fields to them. You have to pay for an add-on to access this functionality."
- **Source**: HighLevel Analysis (2025)
- **Business Impact**: Core feature (document creation) is behind paywall
- **Context**: Have to use multiple tools or pay premium

### Quote 16: Limited Integration
> "My main pain point is that whilst you can link Google Drive, it only allows you to access My Drive documents and not ones on a shared drive."
- **Source**: G2 Review (July 2025)
- **Business Impact**: Can't access team documents, defeats purpose
- **Context**: Half-baked integrations

### Quote 17: Clunky Interface
> "While it's excellent for basic signing, some of the more advanced features can feel a bit complicated to set up...the interface occasionally feels a little clunky when formatting fields, and the mobile app isn't always as seamless as the desktop experience."
- **Source**: G2 Review (2025)
- **Business Impact**: Not mobile-friendly despite signing documents on phones
- **Context**: Design feels dated

## SLOW SALES & IMPLEMENTATION

### Quote 18: 3-Month Sales Cycle
> "We were renewing a fairly low scope agreement with Docusign and it took 3 months to get towards even getting an order form. Start early they can be incredibly slow."
- **Source**: Vendr Procurement (2025)
- **Business Impact**: 3 months just to negotiate renewal
- **Context**: Sales team optimized for enterprise deals, ignores smaller accounts

---

## OVERALL SENTIMENT & DISTRUST

### Quote 19: Scam Allegations
> "Many consumers report issues with customer service, citing difficulties in reaching support and resolving problems. Some consumers even go so far as to label the company as a scam, warning others to avoid it."
- **Source**: Trustpilot Summary
- **Business Impact**: Brand damage, distrust
- **Context**: Multiple "scam" allegations in reviews

### Quote 20: Lost $21K to Fraud

## YOUR DIFFERENTIATION OPPORTUNITY

Build a product that DocuSign **refuses** to build:

1. **Designed for SMBs, not enterprises**
2. **Transparent pricing from day one**
3. **Real customer support that helps**
4. **Cancel anytime without penalty**
5. **Simple interface anyone can use**
6. **All core features in basic plan**
7. **No surprise charges, ever**
8. **Honest, customer-first company**

The market is clearly ready for this. Customers are **actively searching for alternatives** specifically because they feel ripped off and disrespected by DocuSign.
